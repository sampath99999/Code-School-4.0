# Bootstrap & jQuery Test - User Authentication System

## Overview
This project implements a simple user authentication system using Bootstrap and jQuery. It consists of three web pages: account creation, login, and user information display. 

## Features
1. **Create Account Page (index.html)**
   - Users can register by entering their first name, last name, email, and password.
   - Form validation ensures proper input.
   - Clicking "Next" proceeds to the login page.

2. **Login Page (login.html)**
   - Users enter their registered email and password.
   - Credentials are validated against a dummy API response.
   - On successful login, the user is redirected to the display page.

3. **User Display Page (display.html)**
   - Displays user details such as User ID, First Name, Last Name, and Email.
   - Data is retrieved from the dummy API response.

## Technologies Used
- **Bootstrap** for responsive UI design.
- **jQuery** for form validation and API handling.
- **JavaScript** for authentication logic.

2. Register with the required details.
