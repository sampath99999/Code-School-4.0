"Yessy" is an online platform designed for browsing and purchasing art, featuring a seamless and user-friendly interface. The application includes a navigation bar that allows users to explore different sections such as Buy Art, Sell Art, About Us, Your Account, and Help, with dropdown menus for browsing artwork, viewing orders, and accessing buyer and seller FAQs. Additionally, it offers a search functionality for recipes, where users can enter keywords to find relevant recipes and ingredients. The search system fetches data from the DummyJSON API and displays matching recipes in a grid format. If no results are found, a message stating "No results found" appears.

The application also incorporates dynamic recipe cards that present fetched recipes with an image, name, and a list of ingredients. Clicking on any card opens a modal popup with more details. Moreover, a shopping cart icon is integrated into the navbar, displaying the number of items added, hinting at potential e-commerce features where users can add artwork or other products to their cart. The overall UI is enhanced using Bootstrap for responsiveness and custom CSS styling, providing a sleek and modern look. The navbar has a transparent background that becomes solid on scrolling, and elements like search buttons and dropdown menus are custom-styled for a better visual experience.
